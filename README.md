## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **CORS Proxy**: Uses `api.allorigins.win` to bypass CORS restrictions
2. **HTML Parsing**: Utilizes the browser's DOMParser to extract content
3. **Content Filtering**: Removes non-visible elements (scripts, styles, navigation)
4. **Word Counting**: Splits text on whitespace and filters empty strings
5. **CSV Generation**: Creates downloadable CSV using Blob API

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with flexbox and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No external dependencies
- **Web APIs**: DOM Parser, Fetch API, Clipboard API, Blob API

### Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 60+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 55+
- ‚úÖ Safari 12+
- ‚úÖ Edge 79+
